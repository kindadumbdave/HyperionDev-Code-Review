### Script
 - Developer: I have worked closely with a Dev team in the past, ~3years. My journey in development began in Jan 2021. It started with some of the commmon Frontend technologies. I did not have the finances for formal education and so I bought the narrative of the "self taught developer". After a year of fumbling through learning various frontend technologies I felt I needed a local community, support system, mentor. After a bit of a hunt I managed to find myself a really supportive community. Learning Ruby opened my eyes. After toying around with Ruby on Rails I moved to my current DOC, Java. Java to me feels complete and since picking it up I have had nothing but "ah-ha" moments. On the whole I have little to no experience as a developer but I am familiar with Agile and Scrum from my past experience of working with. Like so many I too am looking to gain further experience as a developer.
 - Educator: to me being a educator is all about regurgitating and cementing knowledge i own to users investied in acquiring it. the degree to which the are invested varies. my experience as an educator thus far has been i youth development coaching and as part of my role in the workplace. in my formative years i begun as a youth leader working within the church, on camps and in summer camp/holiday programs for primary school kids. this was not only in a leadership capacity but as work force and operations too. this has translated to me working in youth development coaching primarily for those who have been previously disadvantaged, at the moment we provide movement coaching for aspiring track athletes and those with and interest in running and/or breathwork. In a more corporate or professional environment I find myself playing the role of educator when introducing a new 3rd party service or change in process. Demo's and documentation for new releases, continued support to users, could be considered congruent to the role of an educator. 
 - I dont own a UPS (yet*fingers crossed*) so when Loadshedding strikes I go to a coffee shop.
