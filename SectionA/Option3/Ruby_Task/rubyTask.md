### Section A

#### Option 3: Ruby Task

##### Pull Request
- A Student has submitted some code for review. The algorithm is intended to solve the challenge below.

##### Challenge
- Write an algorithm to determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backwards and forwards.

- The number 121 is a palindrome. From left to right, it reads 121. From right to left, it reads 121.
The number -121 is not a palindrome. From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it reads 121-. -The number 10 is not a palindrome. From left to right, it reads 10. From right to left, it reads 01.

##### Code Review
- My code review for thi solution can be found in [rubyTaskReview.md](rubyTaskReview.md).

##### P.O.A
- I have not written Ruby in a while and when I did I knew less than I do now, so very little. I need to refresh my memory of the language syntax.
- Copy and paste, or clone, the code submission to and IDE to create an [app.rb]( app.rb ) file.
- Review the immediate errors and //comment accordingly.
- Test the code with standard in's and record the outs.
- Analyze test cases.
- The code is reviewed and findings placed in [reviewRubyTask.md](reviewRubyTask.md).
- The following has been considered in approaching the review:
    - Correctness
    - Efficiency
    - Style
    - Documentation
- Comment on the postive aspects and improvements that are necessary.
